# lein-fw1

A [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) plugin to help create and manage FW/1 projects.

## Usage

```bash
lein plugin install lein-fw 0.0.1
lein fw1 new my-website

Currently the only supported operation is new, but more will be coming to help deploy and manage projects.
